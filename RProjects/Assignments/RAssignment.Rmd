### Instructions
1. This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button, all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.
2. Fill in the code chunks and submit this R markdown file to the assignment on Canvas. Make sure when you save that you have run all cells, so the outputs displace between the cells.
3. make sure to replace the directoryID in the filename with your student ID. 


### Q1 (5pts): Download the file 'Adults_Cleaned.csv' from canvas. Read the file into a dataframe.

  nrow(adultsC)
```

### Q4: (4pts) Check the data types of each column.

```

### Q5: (5pts) How many kinds of occupations are in the dataset?

```

### Q8: (5pts) How many people work more than 40hrs a week?

  nrow(adultsC[adultsC$native.country == 'Mexico' & adultsC$hours.per.week > 40, ])

```

### Q10: (5pt) For people who have got bachelor education or higher, what the is percentage to have income more than 50K?
```{r}

  gtrFiftyK <- nrow(adultsC[(adultsC$education == 'Bachelors' | adultsC$education == 'Masters') & (adultsC$label == '>50K'), ])
  gtrFiftyK
  
  lessFiftyK <- nrow(adultsC[(adultsC$education == 'Bachelors' | adultsC$education == 'Masters') & adultsC$label == '<=50K', ])
  lessFiftyK

  Total.Label <- gtrFiftyK + lessFiftyK
  Total.Label
  
  pcrCollEduGtrFiftyK <- (gtrFiftyK/Total.Label)*100
  pcrCollEduGtrFiftyK
  
```

### Q11: (5pts) What is the average woking hours per week for people who are husband?
